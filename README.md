This project contains exercices based on Excepttion handling.
The package "Exercice1" is about a calculator that adds two integers and print their sum while handling the exception that may occur if the values entered aren't of the required type.
The package "Exercice2" is about creating an array and filling it up with random double numbers, and prompting the iser to enter a value of an index to check the corresponding value in the array. This too handles exceptions about arrayIndexOutOfBounds and others.
In the last package, we check if the our diffeernt declared triangles are valid or not.

WE used Microsoft vizio for the UML diagrams.
